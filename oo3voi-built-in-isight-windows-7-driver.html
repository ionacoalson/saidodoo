Therefore, the Mac OS didn't give the drivers, etc. Anyone know if there is a utility, either from Apple or from third parties, where I can tell Windows 7 that I'm using an Apple keyboard? 7 455,60 —Ä—É–±. –õ—É—á—à–∏–π –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞–≤–µ—Ü. 827,66 —Ä—É–±. –∑–∞ –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∫—É. –ù–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è: –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–±—Ä–∏—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—è. 9 –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞–Ω–æ.
